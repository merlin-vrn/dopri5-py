An attempt to explore chaos in the Lorenz attractor in Python using Dorman-Prince 5(4) numerical solver

The program contains a complete solver using algorithm descrpbed in the well-known textbook "Solving Ordinary Differential Equations I: Nonstiff Problems" by Hairer, Nørsett and Wanner, with the "dense output" extension. That solver is being used to find the period-doubling bifurcations in the Lorenz strange attractor. A Poincaré section is used for that.
